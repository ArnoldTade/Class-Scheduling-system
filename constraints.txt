The algorithm or code will generate output in ClassSchedule models. I think for simplicity the algorithm will use the InstructorCourse to create the ClassSchedule.
     In the InstructorCourse, the instructor, course and sections is already set. All there is to do is to assign the room,  start_time, end_time, days of week. 

    In the InstructorCourse.instructor.status
        Instructor Availability:
            if the InstructorCourse.instructor.status is
                Permanent  instructors can teach from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm Monday to Saturday, with the possibility of teaching until 8:00 pm as overload.
                Temporary instructors can teach from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm Monday to Saturday, with the possibility of teaching until 8:00 pm as overload.
                Full-time part-time instructors can teach the same hours as Permanent and Temporary instructors.
                Part-time instructors can only teach from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm Monday to Saturday.

    College Selection:
        Generate schedules only for instructors and rooms within the same college as specified by the user.


InstructorCourse:
	Instructors have already pre selected their course and sections
	All there is to do is to assign them to a time slot and rooms

Course Scheduling:
	Courses with Lab and Lecture format need specific room types.
	Avoid scheduling classes during lunch break (12:00 pm noon).
	Avoid scheduling multiple classes in the same room and at the same time.
	Avoid scheduling conflicts.

Semester and Year:
	I will set variables named varCollege, varSemester and varYear
	Generate schedules based on the selected college in value of varCollege, semester in value of varSemester, and year in value of varYear, provided by the user.

Room Assignment:
	Assign rooms based on the type of course (Lecture, Lab and Lecture) and the availability of rooms within the same college.

Course 
	If the credits field has a value of 3, it means there can be 3 hours of teaching per week.
	The hours field specifies how many hours are being taught per week. For example, if hours is 3, then only 3 hours are being taught each week.
	The type field can be either "Lec" or "Lab and Lec".
	If the type is "Lec", the course can be assigned to a room with a room_type of 	Lecture.
	If the type is "Lab and Lec", the course can be assigned to a room with a room_type 	of Lab and Lecture.
	For example, if a course has credits and hours both set to 3, and its type is "Lab 	and Lec", then the ClassSchedule should create a schedule such as:

	Tuesday 8:30 - 10:00 am: Lecture room_type
	Thursday 8:30 - 10:00 am: Lab and Lecture room_type
